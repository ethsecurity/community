## Community Funding and Project Wishlist

- Dev Process Guidelines funding
- Assessment Guidelines funding
- Funding for ETHSecurity WIki maintenance
- Infrastructure/tooling auditing fund
- Smart Contract Weakness maintenance
- NPM Security signaling mechanism - https://gist.github.com/dominictarr/9fd9c1024c94592bc7268d36b8d83b3a
- Access control common architecture
- Debugger
  - Revive TOB debugger?
  - EVM bytecode debugger
- Flags for deprecated or unmaintained repos. 
  - Cargo implementing these flags - npm for RUST
  - Right now a maintainer must explicitly sat they are no longer maintaining, but could be community sourced. 
- Bytecode lifting
  - It seems useful to lift EVM and possibly WASM bytecode to LLVM IR to enable debugging tools to be more general.
